So Imma be real with im kinda stupid nowhere in the assignment did it say to use express but I did and now I'm having trouble getting it to work on netlify.
There is a package netlify-lambda and netlify-cli that are supposed to be able to help with this but I cant find a version of either of those packages with >10 vulnerabilities.

npm install
npm run lint
node src/server.js
